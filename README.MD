## Degenerate impractical software only when nputting eRotiSm dRawings

### Excuse me, what the frick?

Ever saw a good ~~furry y-~~ meme you wanted to show to your friends, but didn't want to use and store it on your phone?

Or do you just want to give a good ~~revgenge~~ surprise to someone?

Then this is the script *for you!*

- This python script allows you to make **flipbooks** from **GIFs** or **videos** in various formats.
- Run the script with you favourite options, and then you're ready to go; you just have to print and assemble the rest!
- It uses imagemagick and ffmpeg to fullfill your wildest fantasies ~
- You shoud be able to choose the scaling and fps if I'm not too lazy to implement it!

### Ok... but how tf am I even supposed to use it?

it's hard to write documentation for something that doesn't even exist yet lol
